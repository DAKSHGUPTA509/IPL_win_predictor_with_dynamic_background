## Project Overview💡

This project uses machine learning to predict the win probability of teams in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match. By analyzing real-time conditions such as the current score, wickets fallen, and overs remaining, the model provides the percentage chance of each team winning. This allows fans to get a data-driven perspective on the match's progress! 📈

## Installation🛠

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
    > pip install pandas scikit-learn flask
    >     > **Note:** Replace `app.py` with the actual name of your main script if it's different.

4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the address shown in the terminal). 🌐

5.  Enter the match details in the application to view the win probability predictions. 📊

    > **Note:** The default port might be different based on your configuration.  Specify how to change the port if needed.

## Dynamic Background🖼

The application features a dynamic background that changes based on the match situation. The background color and images adapt to reflect key moments in the game, such as wickets falling or significant score changes, enhancing the user experience. 🌟

> **Note:** Elaborate on how the dynamic background changes based on specific match events (e.g., background turns red when a wicket falls, changes to team colors based on the current leading team). Include any relevant configuration options for customizing the background behavior.  For example, mention any configuration files or settings where users can customize the color schemes or trigger events.
